1. If I start in my root directory (in this case it is called directories). How would I navigate to the directory called food?

cd images/clipart/food

2. From food, how would I navigate to Poe, EdgarAllen?

cd ../../../e-texts/Poe,EdgarAllen

3. How would I be able to tell the contents of Poe, EdgarAllen?

ls

4. Navigate to images, and use the command that will tell you the exact path of where you are. 

cd /directories/images
pwd

5. While in images, create a folder called photographs. 

mkdir photographs

6. Navigate to your new directory, and create a new file called sunrise. Oh, and make it a .jpg file. (Windows get a freebie here).

cd photographs
vi sunrise.jpg (to actually enter the edit mode and save it first)
touch sunrise.jpg (will create a 0 byte file if it doesn't exist)

7. Now move that file back one directory.

mv sunrise.jpg ../. 

8. Change directories to the like folder under monkeys. Open this folder in sublime. 

cd /directories/Monkeys/like
/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl .

If that works, we can do the following:
Create a symbolic link
ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl
now can just use "subl ." or "subl <filename>" everywhere

9. Bonus! Remove the bananas.html file from the like folder. 

rm bananas.html
